# Functional Testing

## Unit and Integration Testing

For frontend, we perform unit and integration testing with Jest and React 
Testing Library. For backend, unit testing is conducted with golangâ€™s built-in 
testing function: `go test ..`, while integration testing is deployed to the 
User Acceptance Testing backend. For more information,

## Documentation Testing

A sample of the API documentation can be found [here](../../swe/apisample/), 
and the deployment can be accessed at https://findnus.herokuapp.com/

__Search Query Example__

Refer to [`GET` /search](../../swe/apisample/#get-search) for more details.

To perform a search query for the item "Airpods", you may perform a `GET` 
request at the `/search` endpoint with the following URL: 
<a href="https://findnus.herokuapp.com/search?query=Airpods" 
target="_blank" 
rel="noopener">
https:<span>//</span>findnus.herokuapp.com/search?query=Airpods
</a>
You should expect to receive the following response:

```json
[
    {
        "Id":"62b82df7a5d9182afd9665a0",
        "Name":"Airpods",
        "Date":"2022-05-18T00:00:00Z",
        "Location":"UTown Bus Stop",
        "Category":"Electronics",
        "Item_details":"Please call me if found,
         thank you!!",
        "Image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/c5MuKsu.jpg"
    }
]
```

Which is equivalent to the following item
