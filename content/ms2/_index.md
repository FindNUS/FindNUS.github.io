This is the docusite for FindNUS Milestone 2 (Orbital).  
We arranged and tagged (the feedback question number) in this README to fit closely to the evaluation form, for your convenience.

# 1. Acceptance Testing
Please head over to the [FindNUS live site](https://findnus.netlify.app/) to test the site out!

## Featureset
This are the core features we have implemented and tested in **Milestone 2**.
- Stupidly Easy Searching
  - Typo-resistant  
    e.g. "Water bottle" and "W4tr botl" will return the correct item
  - Human Querying  
    No need to specify Category = Cards and fumble around with filters. Typing in anything will return relevant results, similar to Google search.
- Item peeking on home page (view recently submitted items by descending date)
- Item filtering by category for both searching and peek
- User dashboard: View user-uploaded (lost) items, profile
- Item submission logic (both found and lost items): Drag and drop to upload image, dropdown menu to select various fields
- Form field validation for item

**Existing Milestone 1 features**
- SMS login
- App routing
- Protected routing
