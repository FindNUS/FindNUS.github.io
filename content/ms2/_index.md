Hi! This is the docusite for FindNUS Milestone 2 (Orbital).  
We arranged and tagged (the feedback qn number) in this README to fit closely to the evaluation form, for your convenience.  

**Important Links:**

[4.7 Project Logs]()  


# 1. Acceptance Testing
Please head over to the [FindNUS live site](https://findnus.netlify.app/) to test the site out!

## Featureset
This is what we have done in Milestone 2.
- Submission of new lost and found items (POST)
- Viewing a filterable list of lost and found items
- Stupidly Easy Searching
  - Typo-resistant  
    e.g. "Water bottle" and "W4tr botl" will return the correct item
  - Human Querying  
    No need to specify Category = Cards and fumble around with filters. Typing in anything will return relevant results, similar to Google search.
