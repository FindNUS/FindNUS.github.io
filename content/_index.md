# Foreword & Introduction
Welcome to the FindNUS **documentation** website.  
This site is not only meant for Orbital evaluation. It is also intended to serve as a living technical document for Users and Developers to refer to, as well as to document our team's work, thought processes and learning in this Project.

## Proposed Level of Achievement: Artemis
FindNUS aims to attain the **Artemis** level of achievement. 

# Motivation - Why FindNUS?
FindNUS was created because we feel that the current Lost and Found (LNF) system in NUS **sucks**.  

It is decentralized and messy. The official Lost and Found vendor that serves NUS, [RepoApp](https://secure.repoapp.com/public_items/BB20556C) and unofficial telegram groups donâ€™t put user experience first and are generally hard to navigate.  

In our [**Problem Research Page**](/problem), We deep dive into our **project aim** and deepened our understanding of the LNF problem on campus with our  where we document our **user stories** and **LNF competitor analysis**.  

# Project Scope
In our [Project Scope](/scope), we document each Orbital milestone and what features we have accomplished and set forth to do.
