# FindNUS Docusite

## Welcome to FindNUS!
Hello! This is the FindNUS **documentation** website.

If you're here for the live application, [click me](https://findnus.netlify.app/).

## Why FindNUS?
FindNUS was created because we feel that the current Lost and Found system in NUS sucks.  

The official Lost & Found portal is mobile-unfriendly and suffers from low usage because you can only submit items via NUS Security.  

The Lost and Found NUS telegram group sucks even more. Its hard to properly find your items in the sea of messages and spam; not to mention the security issues of being in a huge group.  

We want to change that with FindNUS. FindNUS aims to be super accessible for everyone - the losters and founders. In short, we make it **easy to submit items and search for them**. A detailed writeup can be found in our milestone 1 documentation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X4n5IalejDChWyBY_rGtnBOd1qMa3wq_/view?usp=sharing).
