# Before you start 
## About FindNUS

Welcome to FindNUS. FindNUS is a lost and found item management system which aims to supplement [existing NUS lost and found system](https://nus.edu.sg/osa/student-services/ssc/admin/lost-and-found) in National University of Singapore (NUS) by reducing the barriers for item finders to submit an item online. As such, item losters are more likely to find an item which they have lost on top of items which only make it to the security personnel.

## Features

- Item submission
  - Geocoding of location (Convert location name into actual coordinates)
- Item filtering: View items by category or by date
- User dashboard
  - Profile
  - View submitted items (Edit or delete items that you have submitted)
  - View matching items (Items which are possible matches for your lost item)
- Email notifications: Subscribe to emails when a found item similar to your lost item is submitted

## Accessing the application

The application can be accessed at https://findnus.netlify.app

## Recommended browsers

We recommend using the latest versions of Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers.
