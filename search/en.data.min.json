Hello! This is the FindNUS documentation website.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re here for the live application, click me.\nWhy FindNUS? FindNUS was created because we feel that the current Lost and Found system in NUS sucks.\nThe official Lost \u0026amp; Found portal is mobile-unfriendly and suffers from low usage because you can only submit items via NUS Security.\nThe Lost and Found NUS telegram group sucks even more. Its hard to properly find your items in the sea of messages and spam; not to mention the security issues of being in a huge group.\nWe want to change that with FindNUS. FindNUS aims to be super accessible for everyone - the losters and founders. In short, we make it easy to submit items and search for them. A detailed writeup can be found in our milestone 1 documentation here.\nFor Evaluators For Profs, mentors, advisors and peers. Milestone 2 README\nFor curious onlookers We will be adding a general user guide as part of Milestone 3.\nFor developers We will be adding a technical quickstart document as part of Milestone 3.\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"","content":""}]
